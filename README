EC2-Spot-Price-Value
====================

This stupid little script was designed to figure out whether it is more 
cost effective to run my server on spot instances or on reserved instances.
It calculates cumulative spot cost over the last 90 days and also charts the
spot price, and projects that cost to a full year.

My server must be up 100% and cannot tolerate downtime, so I can compare the
projected cost to reserved instance cost. Historically, the spot price has
been pretty stable and almost equal to the reserved instance hourly price,
without the overhead of the reserved instance one time fee. However, spot
prices have been fluctuating greatly in the last few months (Q3 2011) so it
is now more efficient to buy a reserved instance (especially since Heavy
Utilization instances became available).

See the included demo images for an example of what is generated.
